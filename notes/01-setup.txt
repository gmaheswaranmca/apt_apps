Deploying a PHP web application using Docker Compose
o Nginx 
    - as the web server
o Docker Compose 
    - simplifies the management of multi-container applications
    - making it easy to set up and run your PHP web app with all its dependencies
o
The source code does not work in the containers because
  The error ie"Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by" 
  we got at PHP
  
  and 

  the files "config.php"
            "gf/ar6PhpUtil.php"
            "form/userAndModule/UserAndModuleDb.php"
  we removed end php directive 
    php directive Start         End
                  <?php         ?>             
o 
"docker compose"'s mysql service has 
      "mysqldb" as its name ie service name, 
      "3306" as local port, 
      "3307" as docker port

so, container php connnection string is "mysql:host=mysqldb;port=3306;...."
    whereas host computer workbench connects to "localhost:3307"

For database 
    Run all the one-eight databases     
    Create username and password for apps and set the privileges

o conculsion 
mysqldb, php, nginx are the services of docker compose

Run "localhost:8001/winner" to run the test where winner is the "test link name"


--- 02-admin-server-localhost ---
Simiar setup 

db port: 3308 (outside)
app port: 8002

localhost:8002?dt=20240202&link=one





https://www.bogotobogo.com/DevOps/Docker/Docker-Compose-Nginx-Reverse-Proxy-Multiple-Containers.php

To make the "8002" as nginx server port,
set the port in 
    default.config[1 time] and 
    docker-compose[2 times] files 
            [Total 3 times]
